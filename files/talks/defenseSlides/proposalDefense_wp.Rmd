  - Conditional IR $\rightarrow$ upward/downward bias.
  - Random IR $\rightarrow$ increased variance.
  - IR:
    - Bias towards non-attitudes;
    - Scale reliability;
    - Random sampling not quite random.
  - Can think of it as a missing data problem (MCAR, MAR, NMAR).

## Research questions

- Mitigating and **identifying IR** is of high importance for all survey-based research.

--

### 3 Questions

- Article 1: Who are inattentives and how do they behave over multiple survey events?
- Article 2: What is the validity of current measures of inattention in survey research?
- Article 3: How can we holistically assess survey-wide inattention?

## Measurement strategies

.panelset[
  .panel[.panel-name[Direct]
  - **Provide snapshot assessments!**
  - Intructional Manipulation Checks (IMC):
    - "[...] Forget previous instructions and choose 'Strongly Agree'."
    - Can be more or less overt.
  - Bogus/Infrequency items:
    - "I am paid biweekly by leprechauns."
    - Covert
  - Factual Manipulation Checks (FMC)/Mock Vignette Checks (MVC):
    - For experimental designs, to check treatment compliance.

  ]
  .panel[.panel-name[Response time]
  - **Offers global assessment!**
  - Page time indices:
    - Ad hoc threshold (2 seconds per question);
    - Concerned with respondents going too fast.
  - Response Time Attentiveness Clustering (RTAC):
    - 2 steps:  1) PCA; 2) EM clustering.
    - Gives probability of being in each of three clusters:
      1. Fast inattentive;
      2. Attentive;
      3. Slow inattentive.
      
   .small[`r AutoCite(bib, c("huang2012detecting","bowling2021quick","read2022racing"))`]

  .panel[.panel-name[Response pattern]
  - **Offers global assessment!**
  - Longest streak
  - Outlier detection
  - Individual consistency
  
$\mapsto$ Not recommended as offer poor consistency with other measures and are overreliant on strong assumptions.

## A1: Puzzle — Why the inconsistency?

### Possible explanations

1. **Context** $\rightarrow$ UK, USA, Germany

2. **Measurement** $\rightarrow$ RTAC (three types: fast, slow, and attentive)

3. **Model specification** $\rightarrow$ longitudinal analysis via a transition model

4. Diversity of controls

## A1: Puzzle — Research question
### Who are inattentives and how do they behave over multiple survey events?

Specifically:

1. Do the profiles of RTAC-flagged inattentives differ from those flagged by alternative measures?

2. Do the profiles of fast and slow inattentives differ?

---

## A1: Hypotheses
.pull-left[
- **H1:** Fast inattentives are less likely to persist in their inattention across waves compared to slow inattentives for which inattention comes from ability.  

- **H2:** Age, sex, and education should be associated with inattention even when measured by RTAC.  

- **H3:** Slow inattentives are more likely to have lower education levels.

  - 29 survey events (waves);
  - Response time data for waves 25 to 29 (May 2023 to September 2024);

  - Ran in 2016, 2020, and 2024 (pre/post survey design);
  - Response time data only available for 2016 and 2020 for now;
  - 2,670 respondents answered both the 2016 and 2020 waves;
  - Should drop to 2,070 once 2024 is included.

    - Probabilities of being in each.
  - Straightlining:
    - None of the panels contain usable IMCs.
    - Based on the feeling thermometers contained in each panels.
    - Whether or not respondents answered the same thing for all of them.
    - Boolean, whether they straightlined or not.
    - Expect reported levels of IR to be lower using this measure.

  - Sociodemographic variables:
    - Age;

- Transition models via multinomial logistic regression. One for each $m$ categories in IR: $$Pr(y_i=m|\boldsymbol{x}_i,y_{i,t-1}=1)=\frac{exp(\boldsymbol{x}_i\beta_m)}{\sum_{m=0}^{3}exp(\boldsymbol{x}_i\beta_m)}, m=1,2,3.$$
- Perform Marcov-chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC) to be able to do hypothesis tests between models.

  - One could alternativelly approach the analysis from a time series perspective.
  - We have a DGP of the form: $$y_{it}=\phi y_{i,t-1}+\boldsymbol\beta\boldsymbol x_{it}+\alpha_{ci}+\varepsilon_{it}$$
  - OLS-FE is a biased and inconsistent estimator due to the endogeneity between the lagged DV and the errors `r AutoCite(bib, c("nickell1981biases"))`.
  - Small T large N limits the modelling options.

2. Validation of measures is done via nomological validity, testing against established measures `r AutoCite(bib, c("adcock2001measurement"))`;

4. Advice is to carpet bomb the survey `r AutoCite(bib, c("curran2016methods","huang2015detecting","meade2012identifying"))`;

&0 \quad \mathrm{if}\; M_i=1\land A_i=1

Let's describe a model of attention as a function of an external stimuli:

$$\color{#FF0000}{IR_{mi}}=\beta_m D_{i}+\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\gamma_{m}}+\varepsilon_{mi}$$

  1. HRV;
  2. Eye-tracking;
  3. EDA;

**H0.1**. Effective treatment—treatment increases inattentive responding:
- $\beta_m > 0 \forall m$
    
**H0.2**. Validity of baseline—the estimated ITT will not be statistically different whether inattention is measured by eye-tracking, HRV, or EDA:
- $\beta_1\approx\beta_2\approx\beta_3$
  ]
  .panel[.panel-name[**Actual ones**]
**H1** The IMC index will properly capture IR as ability is included in our conceptualization:
- $\beta_1\approx\beta_2\approx\beta_3\approx\beta_4$

**H2** The response time index will present with downward bias as it doesn't capture ability:
- $\beta_5<\beta_1\approx\beta_2\approx\beta_3$
  
**H3** The RTAC will properly capture IR as it accounts for ability in its categorization:
- $\beta_1\approx\beta_2\approx\beta_3\approx\beta_6$
  
**H4** Treatment should affect motivation based IR, hence the ITT should be higher for fast inattentives than for slow inattentives:
- $\beta_{6f}>\beta_{6s}$

- With available ressources, we are aiming at 300 respondents.
- Both in-class recruitment and university-wide invitation.
- Compensation in form of extra credit or money ($10) base on recruitment type.

## A2: Design — Analysis

Recall the original model: $$IR_{mi}=\beta_m D_{i}+\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\gamma_{m}}+\varepsilon_{mi}$$

- Can be directly estimated via seemingly unrelated regression (SUR).
- This jointly estimates all $m$ models.
- Why? 
  - To account for possible relationships between the residuals of the different DVs `r AutoCite(bib, c("greene_econometric_2018"))`.
  - To produce hypothesis tests between models. 
- Estimation of SUR is implemented in `systemfit` package in R.

## A2: Design — Why do it this way?

.pull-left[
1. IR isn't guarantee to happen in every survey, especially one taking place in a university laboratory.
2. The Tobii glasses, Biopac ring, and ECG will likely worsen this.
3. Can be turned into a within design to check for power related issues if treatment isn't satistically significant.
4. If both fail, I will still have great descriptive data with which I can compare eye-tracking to response time measures.

- Will pilot it as a simple survey to see if treatment works.
- Can measure eye mouvement (WebGazer) and HRV (rPPG) via a webcam, this way I could have a lot more respondents.

## A3: Puzzle

1. Poor fit between the different measures of inattention (IMC, response time, response pattern) `r AutoCite(bib, c("dunn2018intra","desimone2018dirty"))`;

2. Validation of measures is done via nomological validity, testing against established measures `r AutoCite(bib, c("adcock2001measurement"))`;

3. Conceptual confusion among foundational studies `r AutoCite(bib, c("oppenheimer2009instructional","meade2012identifying","huang2012detecting"))`;

4. Advice is to carpet bomb the survey `r AutoCite(bib, c("curran2016methods","huang2015detecting","meade2012identifying"))`;

--

5. **Let's assume that these are all valid ways to measure the same multidimentional concept.**

Appendix: Motivation 1/2

### Why take a survey in the first place if all you're going to do is skip through it?

> "Despite the number and variety of these motives, however, they probably lose their potency relatively quickly during a survey interview. Respondents are likely to satisfy whatever desires motivate them to participate just a short way into an interview, and they are likely to become increasingly fatigued, disinterested, impatiant, and distracted as the interview progresses. This situation presents respondents with a dilemma. Their motivation to work hard has evaporated, and the cognitive costs of hard work have become increasignly burdensome."

## Appendix: How opinion formation model fit with IR?
.panelset[
  .panel[.panel-name[RAS]
- The model:
  1. Individuals receive information from the outside world;
  2. They either accept and internalize them or not;
  3. Respondents sample top-of-mind information to provide answer.
- How it fits:
  1. Online updating supposes a set of already formed or pre-processed opinions;
  2. Questions relating to this set are easier to answer;
  3. Hence, subject familiarity reduces cognitive load.
  ]
  .panel[.panel-name[JQP]
- The model has 2 pathways:
    1. Hot cognition:
      - Affective tags are placed on previously encountered social objects;
      - Once re-encountered, the individual's reaction will be tinted by the original affective tag;
      - This results in an immediate positive/negative reaction.
    2. Online updating:
      - Occurs when new information is encountered about a social object;
      - Running tally associated with that object is updated;
      - Results in higher cognitive load, making that pathway slower.
- How it fits:
  - Essentially an emotionally driven RAS model.
  - Helps explain why some questions produce immediate answers and why others require longer processing.

## Appendix A1: Why USA, UK, and Germany?

- CONVENIENCE!
- Perhaps effects of culture? 
  - Maybe "thighter" cultures (norm enforcing) would yield lower amounts of IR in surveys.
  - Three countries score similarly (5.1, 6.9, and 7 respectivelly) on cultural tightness scale `r AutoCite(bib, c("gelfand2011differences"))`.
- Still, expanding the selection would be nice, especially since the literature is entirely based on western countries.
